# Car Simulation Project Documentation

Welcome to the Car Simulation Project! This project simulates car movements with a focus on steering behaviors, utilizing PID controllers for navigation, and supporting both standard and 4-wheel steering systems.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective simulation environment for car steering behaviors, including both traditional and four-wheel steering systems. The simulation is built using Python and Pygame, offering a visual representation of car dynamics.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py
